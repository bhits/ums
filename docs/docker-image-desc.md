# What is UMS?

The User Management Service (UMS) is a component of Consent2Share(C2S). It manages the user account creation process, user account activation, user disable, user update, and persisting of the user demographics. The UMS has been designed to support various roles for a given user such as Admin, Parent, Guardian, Patient, and so on. If it is configured to do so, it also registers user demographics (if the user is also a patient) to a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) server.

# How to Use This Image

## Start a UMS Instance

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the repository's [README.md](https://github.com/bhits-dev/ums) file before starting the instance.

`docker run  --name ums -d bhitsdev/ums:latest <additional program arguments>`

*NOTE: In order for this project to fully function as a microservice in the Consent2Share application, it is required to setup the dependency microservices and the support level infrastructure. Please refer to the Consent2Share Deployment Guide in the corresponding Consent2Share release (see [Consent2Share Releases Page](https://github.com/bhits-dev/consent2share/releases)) for instructions to setup the Consent2Share infrastructure.*
 
## Configure

The Spring profiles `application-default` and `docker` are activated by default when building images.

This project can run with the default configuration which is from three places: `bootstrap.yml`, `application.yml`, and the data which the [`Configuration Server`](https://github.com/bhits-dev/config-server) reads from the `Configuration Data Git Repository`. Both `bootstrap.yml` and `application.yml` files are located in the class path of the running application.

We **recommend** overriding the configuration as needed in the `Configuration Data Git Repository`, which is used by the `Configuration Server`.

Also, [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) supports other ways to override the default configuration to configure the project for a certain deployment environment. 

The following is an example to override the default database password:

`docker run -d bhitsdev/ums:latest --spring.datasource.password=strongpassword`

## Environment Variables

When you start the UMS image, you can edit the configuration of the UMS instance by passing one or more environment variables on the command line. 

### JAR_FILE

This environment variable is used to setup which jar file will run. You need to mount the jar file to the root of container.

`docker run --name ums -e JAR_FILE="ums-latest.jar" -v "/path/on/dockerhost/ums-latest.jar:/ums-latest.jar" -d bhitsdev/ums:latest`

### JAVA_OPTS 

This environment variable is used to setup a JVM argument, such as memory configuration.

`docker run --name ums -e "JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx700m -Xss1m" -d bhitsdev/ums:latest`

### DEFAULT_PROGRAM_ARGS 

This environment variable is used to setup an application argument. The default value is: "--spring.profiles.active=application-default, docker".

`docker run --name ums -e DEFAULT_PROGRAM_ARGS="--spring.profiles.active=application-default,ssl,docker" -d bhitsdev/ums:latest`
